The Architecture of the Internet
The internet is a global network of computers communicating through standardized protocols.

The Client-Server Model: The Client (my browser) requests data, and the Server (a remote computer) fulfills that request.

IP Addresses & DNS: Every server has a unique IP address (like a phone number). The DNS (Domain Name System) acts as a phonebook, translating human-readable names like google.com into machine-readable IP addresses.

Packets: Data is broken down into small units called packets, routed across the globe via different paths, and reassembled at the destination.

The Components of a Webpage: > * HTML: The skeleton/structure.

CSS: The skin/styling.

JavaScript: The muscle/interactivity.

Clinical Analogy: A doctor (Client) sends a test requisition (URL) via a courier (HTTP) to the lab (Server). The lab looks up the patient (DNS), processes the sample, and sends back a report (Response) for the doctor to interpret.
