The Importance of Community in Tech
Learning in public is a core part of my development strategy. By joining The Odin Project Discord, I have:

Established a Presence: Introduced myself as a transitioning professional from the clinical lab to the tech space.

Linked Professional Identity: Connected my GitHub to my Discord to ensure transparency and accountability in my learning.

Resource Access: Gained access to thousands of developers who have solved the same problems I will face.

Goal: To eventually contribute back to the community by answering questions once I have mastered the foundational concepts.
