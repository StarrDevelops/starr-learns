Mindset in Software Engineering
Fixed Mindset: The belief that technical ability is innate. If a concept or bug isn't understood immediately, it is viewed as a permanent personal limitation. This leads to early burnout and abandonment of goals when faced with "The Desert of Despair."

Growth Mindset: The belief that competence is built through incremental steps. It recognizes that current struggles are merely "steps" toward a goal.

Application: When facing a "wall" in coding, a growth mindset allows for a strategic retreat—reassessing, researching, and returning with a new perspective. This flexible perseverance ensures forward momentum regardless of the difficulty of the path.
