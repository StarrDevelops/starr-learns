Topic: CLI Navigation and File Management

The Power of the Shell
CLI vs. GUI: Moving from visual interaction to direct command input for increased speed and server-side compatibility.

Navigation Mastery: Using cd, ls, and pwd to traverse the Linux file system within WSL2.

File Operations: Learning to create (mkdir, touch), move (mv), and remove (rm) files without a mouse.

Warning: The command line has no "Undo" or "Recycle Bin" for the rm command. Precision is mandatory.
