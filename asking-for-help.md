How to Ask Technical Questions
To get fast, helpful answers in the tech community, I follow the State, Try, Provide framework:

State the Goal: Clearly define what the end result should look like.

State the Attempt: List exactly what was tried (code snippets, specific tags, or settings changed). This prevents people from suggesting things I've already done.

Provide Context: List the OS (Windows/WSL2), the tools (VS Code), and any specific error messages received.

The XY Problem: I must be careful not to ask for help with my guessed solution (Y), but rather the original problem (X). Example: Instead of asking "How do I fix the color tag?", ask "How do I change the text color of a header?"
